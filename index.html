        <h2>Proof of Concept</h2>
        <p>This proof of concept showcases the integration of AI technologies for diagnosing plant and animal diseases, providing real-time assistance to farmers and veterinarians through an intelligent dashboard. The system uses machine learning and AI for accurate disease identification, paired with real-time video consultations.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>AI-driven disease identification through image and text analysis.</li>
            <li>Video consultation support for direct farmer-veterinarian communication.</li>
            <li>Data storage and analysis using MongoDB for personalized insights.</li>
            <li>Real-time AI assistance through the intuitive farmer and vet dashboards.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Live Consultation</h3>
        <p>Our WebRTC-based live consultation system ensures seamless communication between farmers and veterinarians, enabling them to discuss disease conditions in real-time, enhancing both diagnosis accuracy and response time.</p>
        <h3>How It Works:</h3>
        <p>Our platform processes images and text input through advanced AI models, analyzing disease symptoms in plants and animals. Farmers can upload images or text descriptions, and veterinarians receive real-time alerts for consultation, allowing remote diagnostics and support.</p>
